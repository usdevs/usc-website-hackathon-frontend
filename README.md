This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

### Requirements

Install the following:

- Node.JS version - 18.12.1 LTS (would recommend that you install through [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
- npm - 8.19.2

## Initial setup

1. `npm install`
2. `cd <frontend repo> && npm run dev`

### Spinning up your own backend locally

Currently, the frontend will connect to the same DigitalOcean server (to avoid spinning up a Docker instance on your local machine). If you are going to be doing heavy development work and thus will make lots of calls to the database, you may wish to spin up your own backend locally to avoid affecting other developers. Run the following commands:
1. `cd <backend repo> && npm run dev`
2. `cd <backend repo> && docker-compose up`

Make sure to change the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` constant in the  `.env.development` file to `http://localhost:3000/`.


### Telegram login token

1. EITHER go to https://usdevs.github.io/uscwebsite-hackathon-backend/, login, copy the token and paste it into `const NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_JWT_DEV =` on line 8 in `components/Auth.tsx`. Copy your userId from the "Users" table in the DB to NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_TELEGRAM_USER_ID on line 7.
2. OR Tried to Dockerise this, view `docker` branch
3. OR Linux set-up to set up nginx as a proxy (should be roughly similar for Mac, not sure about Windows)
4. Install `mkcert` from https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert and generate certs for a domain. I am using `frontend.local.dev`. (run the commands in `certgen.sh` in the nginx folder)
5. In your hosts file, add `127.0.0.1 frontend.local.dev`
6. Copy the `app.conf` in the nginx folder over to `/etc/nginx/conf.d` or to a path that you have included in your `nginx.conf` (see the sample `nginx.conf`'s line 17 to see how you can include the `conf.d` directory on a Mac machine - Linux should have this by default)
7. `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx` for Linux, `sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s stop && sudo nginx` for MacOS
8. If you have `apache` running, need to deconflict it as pgadmin uses it as well. You can change the port it uses, or change nginx's port. Otherwise, you can just `sudo service apache2 stop` and not use pgadmin.
9. You will have to update the Tele bot's BOT_TOKEN on the backend repo to '5980011686:AAHuxodOvlPYeftZTElSpC-13ybW5to9Y1M' if you used frontend.local.dev, or you can set up your own Tele login bot or let me know if you want to use another domain.
10. Change NEXT_PUBLIC_NGINX_PROXY_ON in line 9 in Auth.tsx to true!

## YOU CAN FINALLY LAUNCH THE FRONTEND

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the frontend.

## Note

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3001/api/hello](http://localhost:3001/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
